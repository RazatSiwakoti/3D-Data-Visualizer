# 3d Data Visulizer

## Overview
This repository explores two different types of dataset: 3D dataset and comma separated values('csv') and integrates data visualisation techniques using programmatically generated plots and diagrams.<br>
There are two tasks:<br>
## Tasks 1
Visualise the given 3D dataset onto 2D plane, 3D plane and scatter plot with two histograms
### Task 2 
Use any data visulisation methods to visulise the given data set using data mining techniques

#### Contents
1. **Code:** Each folder contains the main Python script (`.py`) which is the entire pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation

2. **Data:** Different datasets (`.csv`) are used for the implementation of data mining algorithms. Ensure the dataset is stored in the same directory before running the script.

3. **Visualizations:** The `pictures` folder contains plots illustrating the distribution of the target variable and other relevant relationships within the dataset.

4. **Requirements:** The `requirements.txt` file lists the necessary Python packages to run the code successfully. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
